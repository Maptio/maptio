- Should the content be stored in MongoDB.datasets or reference a url/tabel that contains the content ? 
Thougts : 
1. MondoDB doesnt handle joins very nicely so prbably better to have as little collections as possible
2. DO no resttict yourself to MongoDB, is there any other JSON staore ?
3. Investaige how easy it is to store JSON as a string in Mongo before you make any decision
