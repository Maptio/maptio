# Circle mapping

For founders of purpose-driven companies and initiatives who want to create a scalable, autonomous and focussed organisation structure and culture.
Our simple online initiative mapping tool visualises who has taken responsibility for what and who is helping who to meet those responsibilities
So that people throughout the organisation can: 

- make autonomous decisions while at the same time supporting the autonomy of others, all the way up to the founder holding the overall vision
- see how responsibilities throughout the organisation feed into the greater system
- enjoy greater transparency
- avoid the tyranny of heavy-weight processes, bureaucracy and excessive management.
